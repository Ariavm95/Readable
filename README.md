## Intro
This is the project of React-Redux class which is part of an advance nanodegree program at Udacity.
The Readable project is basically a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.
Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Server
The server is built in Node, but it is very simple.

## Getting started
* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* Install and start the server for the front-end
   
    - `cd Readable-master`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## Deployed version
I deployed both servers on Heroku; so you can check it out [here](https://readable--app.herokuapp.com/).
The Heroku servers go to sleep after some idle time; so it may take some time for the servers to wake up.
